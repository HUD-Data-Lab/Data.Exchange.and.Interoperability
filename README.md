# Data.Exchange.and.Interoperability
Repository for Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) development and management of products to support data exchange and interoperability

## Disclaimer: THIS IS A BETA VERSION
THE BETA VERSION IS STILL IN THE TESTING PHASE AND IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND IS BELIEVED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS AND A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS BETA IS TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK ON SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF DEFECTS.

## HMIS API
The HMIS API was developed in collaboration with the Data Exchange and Interoperability Workgroup, which included several HMIS vendors and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 

It is intended to support Continuums of Care (CoCs) in implementing data exchange and interoperability processes in their communities. Specifically, the HMIS API Reference aims to facilitate real-time data exchange that directly benefits people experiencing homelessness by reducing the need for duplicative storytelling and improving access to critical services or supports needed to resolve their housing crisis. It also minimizes the data entry burden on service providers by reducing duplicative data entry, allowing them to focus more on delivering care.

### HMIS API Specification
- Follow this link to view the [HMIS API Specification](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HUD-Data-Lab/Data.Exchange.and.Interoperability/refs/heads/main/hmis_api_ld_0.4.yaml)
- For additional information about the HMIS API Specification please refer to the [HMIS API Reference Guide](https://github.com/HUD-Data-Lab/Data.Exchange.and.Interoperability/blob/main/doc/HMIS%20API%20Reference%20Guide%20v1.0.md)

## Toolchain for extensions
In addition to the HMIS API Specification a python toolchain can be used to develop custom API Specifications, extensions to other standards (such as the [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://build.fhir.org/index.html)). This toolchain requires the use of the HMIS Logic Model. For additional.
For more information on this toolchain and the HMIS Logic Model please refer to the following resources:
